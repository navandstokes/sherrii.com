#Introduction
Engineering design is in some senses intangible and mystical. Yet we come in contact with the fruits of engineering design every second of every day. In my portfolio, I will give a personal definition of this important concept and its process. In addition, my skills and future development will be highlighted with examples of my work. In my perspective, engineering design can be divided into two components. The minute details and the bigger considerations. Realism and the idealistic. The prior is engineering; the latter, design. Engineering design is the optimal balance between the two.

As such, my engineering design process aims to incorporate appropriate amounts of both engineering and design. First, a complete understanding of the problem must be reached. This means interacting with the environment given by the problem and also learning about other similar problems. Second, an iterative idea generation and selection process must be practiced. It is often difficult to immediately discover a perfect solution to a problem, these processes help the design process. Lastly, a solution to a problem in the real world must be realistic. This should ensured before moving ahead. The conclusion of such an engineering design process should produce an appropriate solution given a good balance of the two concepts.

My stronger skills are pertaining more to design. I can understand a problem holistically and focus on important considerations when designing. My skills in engineering are less adequate. Although I work well with prototypes and ensuring realism through them, I tend to overlook details of a design. I like to maintain the spirit of a problem rather than its exact scope and framing. As such, the areas I would like to work on in the future is learning to work with tight constraints and supporting my conceptual designs with meaningful calculations.

#Philosophy
*Engineer [en-juh-neer]* verb: to devise a realistic solution to a problem.

This is my personal definition of engineering. The goal of an engineer is always to project realism and guarantee that any solution will not fail in the real world. To ensure this, engineers must look at the multitude of factors regarding a solution and understand each one absolutely. Engineering focuses on the details of a problem (e.g. meeting constraints, codes, and standards).

*Design [dih-zahyn]* verb: to holistically approach a problem.

My definition of design is less strict. Design involves analysing environments and how elements interact with each other. The analysis of such gives intuition, which is then used to highlight certain criteria over others, and to make informed decisions about a solution. It is also using this intuition that main considerations in a design process are formed. To design means maintaining the spirit of an idea or problem.

*Engineering Design*

The combination of these two terms creates a process that is quite circular but fairly complete. To do engineering design means that any solution responds to the spirit of a problem, appropriate to the context, and containing details to ensure a successful application in the real world. An engineering design process reflects this.

#Skills
The skills that I have developed as an engineer and a designer are closely linked with my engineering design process. Some skills have developed further than others; below is an outline of my development.  

##Background research (contacting stakeholders, etc)
My skills in background research have definitely strengthened throughout my practice of engineering design. Examples of this can be found here and here.

##Reference design research
I believe I have improved the most in this area. My engineering design process went from having no research, to having some research without utilizing the information, to, finally, using reference designs to guide the design process.

##Idea generation
Since I have improved reference design research, my idea generation skills has become stronger as well, as demonstrated here.

##Using iterative selection processes
Since having been in contact with decision making processes such as the Pugh matrix, I have learned to use methodical processes to gain intuition and then make informed decisions.

##Prototyping
The act of prototyping has always been a natural instinct (demonstrated here).  Having been continually practicing prototyping, I have been reminded again and again the power and importance of creating prototypes. In addition, I have created prototypes aimed to isolate certain aspects of the design, as seen here and here.

##Working with requirements
Designing within certain criteria and constraints is not an intuitive skill for me. I recognize that it is an integral part of engineering. However, an early example of failure demonstrates that I often underestimate the importance of criteria and constraints. An example of improvement can be found here.

#Details
Engineering the details of a design is a skill that still needs improvement. Although I can usually recognize which details are the most important, I tend to overlook those details and adopt vague arguments. (The only example of this is that my teammates have taken up this task for me.)

In summary, my stronger skills are mostly focused towards design (as measured by my own definitions). My engineering skills needs improvement.

#Process
1. Environment
Background research is a part of design. Before approaching any problem, the environment must be understood. Furthermore, the problem must be verified. A main component of this step is contacting stakeholders. This step is important because it gives intuition about the problem, which will become important when creating a solution that is realistic. In addition, this step must be repeated throughout the engineering design process, as conditions may have changed.

2. Reference
This step is vital for ensuring that any copyright legalities are not accidentally breached. But more importantly, it is essential to have an appreciation of designs that have (or attempted to) address the problem in a similar context, as design requires comprehension of all elements regarding a problem. The study of these designs results in an understanding of why and how any particular design succeeded or failed. In either case, learning from past designs will be crucial in guiding the engineering design process.

3. Ideas
Following the research above, once the idea generation stage is reached, an understanding of the environment and of other designs is assumed. This is a stage of design. This stage means creating as many seedlings for designs as possible, whether the idea is original or building off of other designs. There are no limitations in this stage. This stage is important because throughout this generation process, the engineering designer must keep all possibilities open. As such, it prevents any unnecessary or extraneous framing or scoping of the problem.

4. Selection
This step is a component of design. The selection process should involve both a subjective, mechanical decision process and a holistic overview. The analysis done for selection must be repeated several times. Each time should improve upon the last, whether that involves change of ideas or change of process. Ideally, the selection should become obvious and easily justifiable.

5. Prototyping
Creating a prototype is an engineering component of this process. Prototyping is often very helpful in simulating how a design works realistically or how a design could interact with users or the environment. In addition, since the prototype is being built in the real world, the process of prototyping ensures that the final design will work realistically. A prototype does not have to satisfy all aspects of the design at once; it needs only to demonstrate one aspect at a time. Furthermore, this practice of isolation often aids in highlighting which aspects are deficient.

6. What is required?
Good engineering design should always satisfy relevant constraints, codes, and standards. When it does not, there must be a strong justifiable reason. In either case, this step is a precautionary measure. To do engineering means to create a realistic solution. If the solution does not satisfy a requirement (with no justification), then it has not answered the problem in a realistic way.

7. The Little Things
Finally, working out details should be done in conjunction with the previous step. Similar to the above step, this stage is also an integral part of engineering.

8. Rinse. Repeat. 
 The  Guideline on the Professional Engineering Practice in Canada defines the act of engineering as involving an iterative process. I, too, believe that iterations fundamentally describe the engineering design process. It is through iteration that designs may improve and that progress can be monitored. Thus, as demonstrated in my illustration, the engineering design process should be circular so that the most ideal solution can be found.
