Sweet girl, 

 

You are moving backwards, jumping at every opportunity for vulnerability, always seeking tragedy. You have managed to bully the scorpion into being your boyfriend. How did this even happen? Things were so good, so ambiguous. Then you wanted definitions. Seek and ye shall find. Indeed, you found so much, about yourself, about him. 

First: He is so perceptive and emotionally mature. What you mistook for naivety was actually deep wisdom in avoidance of complication. His EQ really surprised you. And so, as usual, you thought about how unevenly matched you are.  姑娘他凭什么爱你。

Second: The gate towards happiness still is, as it always has been, guarded by yourself. With the mention of a relationship, he argued that they should always be leading to marriage. You agree. You didn't even want to be with him. In fact, you still can't envision a future. Yet it still hurt you. Now, this will be a grudge held forever, just like before. 

 

Sweet girl, wake up already.
