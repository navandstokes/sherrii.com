#Premonitions
From long ago, a prophecy:

I don’t want children

one day I will abandon them
hide my disappointment in raw eyes
and escape
they will never understand how
much I loved them
never understand why I left
why I chose the world
over their future

before that
I will not get married
and have extravagant affairs
dole out my soul
my lips are storytellers
kissing tales of harsh winters
standing outside your window
waiting
for a part of me
that never left
but also will
never come back

I can not look at you
with your glassy eyes
your stubborn hands
and transparent pen
which won’t stop
recording my future

I wish
that I could

erase

these lines of my hand
