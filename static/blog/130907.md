#Love letters
Make love with the universe. Be the center of your own life. Appreciate everything that the universe has given you. Be excited for the rain, the beauty, the pains. Let no one take away this passion for life.

You are so beautiful. This is a gift from the universe, use it well. But always remember that there’s much more to you than just being pretty. You are smart. You are ambitious. You are capable. Do not forget to express gratitude. Learn to be graceful.

Don’t be afraid. Smile at strangers. Everything is within your reach, you just have to reach for it.

Above all, make love with the universe.
