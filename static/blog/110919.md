#The beginning
Here I am.

The lovesick child of a frozen spring. My emotions really do change with the wind, forever morphing. I think I really am I really am. His meticulous, thoughtful, stubborn but cute nature. Fallen.

Somewhere between unreasonable smiles, I find myself recognizing the need to protect myself. All these insecurities come flowing back. The dominating fear: for loneliness, for empty houses, for that younger me searching for proof that I have not been abandoned. All good things come to an end.

There is talk of life together. Forever. Talk of never. Is this blind trust? Or a willful one? An ambitious one? Everything feels like a dream, like the snow storms of April: here today, gone tomorrow. Forever. How forbidden and impossible that sounds.

But we are so young, so foolish. This is puppy love, a mock of reality a wondrous illusion. I hope that in spite of all, we will persevere.

Persevere.

Persevere.
