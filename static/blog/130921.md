Notes on Vipassana

- Despite its emphasis on being not related to religion or philosophy, in the end you could only accept it as a philosophy. Mostly because of the connections to the four elements, and division of mind and matter. However, it was incredibly logical and respectful of the cynical mind. Trust nothing but your own experience.

- Concentration on awareness of sensations, but do not react with emotions. Complete detachment from everything.

- Subatomic particles, wavelets, vibrations, string theory.

- The entire experience is like taking a bitter medicine, one that you can not swallow immediately but must hold in your mouth until it has dissolved, while being uncertain of its validity.

- It was also the ultimate self-help course. You create your own salvation, no savior, just truth.

- Having an experiential level of understanding..

- Having so much love and compassion for evil and suffering.
