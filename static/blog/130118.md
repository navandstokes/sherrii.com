#Everything passes
 1.

This game this experiment

Where you have complete control

I just want to hold you to kiss you

To curl next to your working form

Why do you keep me waiting

2.

Your absence is sudden

I work hard to keep it this way

Yet I feel so powerless

Against these walls of my own doing

Each urge I feel for you

Are needles of my iron maiden

3.

I will never forget never forget

As I promised I will never forget

The comfort I once sought

The love I once received

All lost to purgatory
