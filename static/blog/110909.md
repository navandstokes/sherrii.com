#Eclipse
You said you’ve given up

(like the sheets of ice assassins you send my way
they try to cut open my window with snowflakes)

I am nobody to you

(the snow has burned a hole into the dying sun
sacrificed their brilliance to hide and seek the moon)

But every time I look back

(they slide down the glass like little kids
trailing fallen stars in their wake)

You’re still following me

(stars are not so reliable
withdrawing my wishes back across my lips)

I wish you would stop

(where they lay waiting for a frozen glare
or just the outline of a crystal you)
