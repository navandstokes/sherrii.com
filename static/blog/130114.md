#Learning
These are the things you’ve learned.

On group:

1. Vision is two pronged. It must be reachable, but require much effort.

2. Leadership is not about taking on everything by yourself. A leader holds the team together.

3. Performance indicators are great assessment tools.

4. Motivation comes not from monetary or simple incentives. Humans are humans: we are purpose maximizers. Motivate using autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

On self:

1. Life unfolds only in moments. Don’t be afraid.

2. Beliefs are nothing to be proud of. It is not an accomplishment.

3. Be the center of your own life.
