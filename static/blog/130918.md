#End, again
This third night brought up a question

And a statement

That soon, it will all have to end

This scorpion who is so gentle

But even to him, you chose to hide your disappointment

Because it hurt you

That he would assume you are weak

It hurt you

That he would voluntarily end this

You were so naively happy with this situation

And thought that it could last forever

You realized, eventually

All good things must come to an end.
