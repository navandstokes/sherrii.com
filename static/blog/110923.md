The way something inspires so spontaneously… A burst of fireworks, a rush of wind, suddenly it’s at your throat fighting to fly out. Every cell feels this excitement as if it was written your genes. It is a natural high, a superpower. Suddenly, reality has no bounds. The truth and beauty of the universe is all within your palm. All you have to do is grab your voice, your lens, your colours, and shoot. This creation was already written in the universe for you to express.

Where does inspiration come from? I feel that it is not a state of being of any describable thing, but an emotion. Inspiration so often surges within me with urgency and intensity. Yet when I look for it, inspiration hides. At times it’s a song, a story, a photo. Or maybe not. Maybe it is really the way the wind flows, or the sounds of an apartment at night. Like a bundle of neurons suddenly being released, like the fragrance of a blooming flower fast-forwarded. Inescapable but beautiful.
