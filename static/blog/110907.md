#Almost a fantasy
i. she lives in vesper

a c minor masquerade
choreographed by her
father of insomniac stars

ii. an euphonic wonderland
her gown hums
a soundless buttercup
the softest hue

iii. solitude is a refuge
a languid lullaby
overtone of pearls
adagio sostenuto

iv. for every romeo
and juliet she
leaves a seraph
a symphony
sonata
stairways to utopia

v. the truth about grace
is that you must cup
your fingertips around
the consonance and
assonance and eloquence

vi. turn up the mute box
let her hear
the silent psalms
gentle melody so calm

vii. where there’s a bridge
between the rests phosphor
meet and give away
halos painted in azure

viii. pianissimo taking
flight the most
crepuscular divine
you will find
this lament of Beethoven

ix. her right hand captures
cupid’s bow and glides
slurs in whisper on
strings of moon
and light

x. take her hips and swirl
the mist so that
your footsteps
orchestrate
ecstasy

xi. a haunting poignancy
succulent delight
ribbon of decrescendos
echo brilliantly imprinted
behind your eyes

xii. suffused love notes
a crescent too flat

xiii. her lucid dreams
are easily misread
she hits the last goodbye
and resonate
waltz
with the night

xiv. human life
begins in darkness
