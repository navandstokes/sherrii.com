#Seduce
she leans forward
you notice her cheeks
photoshopped to perfection
sunset over sea
you whisper finger prints
into her skin

even from day one
discipline was never a crime

she bends down
you notice the back of her knees
blue rivers set in cream
water over stone
you breathe hand prints
into her bones

draw a golden line
you are control personified

she looks up
you notice her teeth
light bulbs turned to pearl
milk over glass
you caress lip prints
into her soul

and if practice makes perfect

that is certainly you
