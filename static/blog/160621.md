#The Girl on the Train
On the train to the market, there is a very attractive girl across from me. Her face still bears signs of youth but her features have a gentle grace and beauty. She is wearing clothes that show off all the right parts, clothes that cover just enough to tempt the imagination, clothes that suggest she has more confidence than she actually does. Our eyes meet a few times. Her sapphires clouds over as she shifts her arms to cover her flat stomach. Her slender fingers come to rest around a thin waist. The train lurches to a stop and she stumbles, glancing at me. Just as quickly, she looks away, turning, stepping off the train. The curve of her hips lead smoothly to long, lean bare legs. I admire her beauty once more through the window as the distance between us grows. On the platform, her body collapses inward, anxiously protecting itself.
