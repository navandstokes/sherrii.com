#Slight Anger
For N:

I recognize my personality. I know that I am stubborn, above all; I am impatient and speak without filter. I am confused and change without warning. I am passionate; I am curious. I know that my initial state is decieving. My politeness and shyness, in combination with this mask of an exterior, leads countless people to mistake me for someone I’m not. I am ambitious and competitive. I am prone to making mistakes. And I am often inconsiderate.

I’m sure you’ve experienced these sides of me by now. I hope that you can accept that some have surprised you. I hope that I did not turn out to be who you thought you had read so easily. Because then, that would not speak volumes about your powress, but about my shallowness. I am not a trope character. I have depth.

And please, stop trying to predict my future. The beauty of this world lies in the uncertainties and surprises. If you are so certain of what is to happen, then we don’t have to meet. I am no longer interested. This is not charming.

Finally, I am sorry. When you looking at me with those pleading, disappointed eyes, I can not spare even a drop of patience. Partially this is because I see my past self, staring back. That part of me that was so vulnerable. But please, wake up, and look at me. I am not this predefined idea that you have formulated. If you want to get to know me, then get to know me. Experience me.
