#Let it rain
From so long ago, for D, I’m sorry:

1- Let it rain; flow; fall. Bring salvation; freedom; hope.
Let me sing; dance; disappear. Give me courage; perseverance; joy.
Stop me from choking; running; screaming. Help me decide; yell; live.
Go away; die; leave. Why are you still here?

2- You make me wonder. Make me want live in solitude. Just when I thought we reached a happy medium. You go and tare it down. The goal flies even higher. And I sink back into the well. Jump left, right, back. Anything to keep you from moving forward. Where does my voice flee when it rains? I sit on a bridge unable to let go. And the tears flow back to where they came from.

3- Where are you going? I don’t want to follow. Please stop
letting me go. Just listen…

4- Even the clouds are whispering, this is not love.
