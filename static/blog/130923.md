The reason that this project was started is not clear. Most likely, you were still on that Vipassana high and wanted to keep improving.  

1. Vegetarian diet - This was more or less successful. Travel and life did get in the way, but you kept up all the other times. 

2. 6:30 AM - This was terrible.  You cannot stay with one fixed schedule, and the messed up times at which you commanded your body to function prevented you from even coming close to success. Dear, you need more discipline.  

3. Heels - So far it is not bad. However, now you understand which pair of shoes are truly impossible to walk in, no matter how beautiful they are.  

4. Inbox zero - Not too difficult to achieve. But stop putting things off!

5. Black and white

6. TED

7. To-do zero

8. Library

9. Stretching
