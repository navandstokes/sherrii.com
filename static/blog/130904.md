#因为痛所以叫青春
The first and third are coupled. Every detail, every exchange mirror each other  in uncanny unison. The first chased after me. The third was chased by me. But in both cases, although Daphne was willing, the laurel still stands immortal. When I was still forced to act tenacious, the first told me I was delicate. And in my moment of vulnerability, the third reminded me that I was strong.

The second and fourth surprised me. When I was so resolved, so sure of my emotions, like a child, I was wrong. With no warning, their presence filled my mind. The surprises bestowed to me were mostly about myself. I found that I was willing to change, that I was willing to give, that I still had so much to learn. The second frustrates me with his inconsiderate independence. The fourth humiliates me with his grace. But I am grateful for both, for I know that their mark on my life goes beyond simple brushstrokes. They have changed me, and shaped my future.
