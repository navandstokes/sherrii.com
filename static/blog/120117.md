#Research
A reminder from Jan 17th, 2012:

Theoretical research. On one hand, it seems so indescribably boring. No real creativity: just hypothesis and testing; lab coats and clipboards. On the other, it seems so indescribably exciting. The world of academia where one is in direct contact with the opportunity to create and verify genuine new ideas. Is this a trade off  Nevertheless, I have come to understand that nano-engineering will allow me both the door towards commercialism and the step ladder to academia.

I have realized that I have indeed missed chemistry. Even though everything seems a bit hazy, this exciting feeling grows in me. It is like I am back in that physics class learning about projectile motion and grinning all the way. Euphoria from learning.

C has been hired by MIT to do cancer research. If this does not motivate me I do not know what will.

Life is short. Live your dream and wear your passion.
