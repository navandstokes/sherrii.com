#Return the favor
I still remember sleepless nights
Silent tears streaming down my face
A boy by my side
Stop crying it's bad for your skin
He tells me
I remember hiding under the bathroom sink
Squishing myself into the smallest space
Just wishing I could disappear into the surroundings

I always believed
Because I could bare such pain
Then I must be able to experience just as much joy

That's how it is 
Comes and goes like the tide
Unlike my other cycles 
I can't predict when it will take over 
Or how long it will stay

During the best times 
I began with J
I became a bubbly cute girl with him
But I'm afraid to unveil the real me

I am alone
Of course that is not really true
It's just my mind isolating itself
Refusing any outstretched arms
Rejecting help

Even now
I can't face the confrontations necessary to mend my relationships
Not because I'm afraid to point out their mistake
But because I'm afraid to recognize mine own 

Logically I understand the next steps
But I can never follow through
So instead...

On the balcony with the sunset views of Melbourne harbor
I fantasize about leaping from its bounds


On the clifftop of Bali's volcano
I imagine what it'll be like to jump
To feel the wind and then the earth

On the beaches of Sydney, in front of pure clean waves
I dream about walking in and never returning

Midway through my plans 
I understood
Travel will not solve my problems
I am who I am
As with anything, this will require hard work
But travel did give me hope
At the best of times it showed me so much beauty so much kindness

I need to be alive to return the favor
