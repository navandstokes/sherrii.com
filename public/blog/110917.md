My dear bull,

Perhaps we’re just not right for each other.

I’m always waiting, listening, looking forward to.

Yearning.

Yearning.

Yearning.

And learning.

About loneliness. About how painful it is to be lonely when you’re with someone. Not the trivial physical loneliness. It is when you are isolated that you feel so connected with the world. But the loneliness found in relationships, any kind of relationship, that is true loneliness. The feeling of solitude is someone’s arms.

About inarticulacy. About having so much trapped inside you that nothing new can flow in, nothing healing. There are a billion tiny birds fighting to fly out, to burst into the still air. But instead, you listen to the leaves falling, and the clouds moving, and you know that the eloquence of the wind has already spoken for you.

About tenderness. Like tofu, you are so strong when a large knife presses upon you, but so delicate when it is a pinpoint needle. There is no fighting back. All you are allowed to do is to wait, hoping endlessly that the needle will leave intricate paths, so that at least the scars will be beautiful.
