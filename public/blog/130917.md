#Power
Yesterday the scorpion injected you with its poison. You felt a heat like no other; a fire wild enough to destroy endless forests. At that moment, your desire to quench that thirst was insurmountable. Your body becomes solely the vessel of Dionysus.

The lightning and thunder and pouring rain outside the window was so beautiful. All of that anxiety – released. Pathetic fallacy.

Afterwards, as you sat by the window, all those stones came back. You heard, and hurt yourself, once again. But all that beauty prevented you from falling. You realized that although the bull healed many wounds, he also left some new ones. But it is wise to not let this become resentment. Accept this, and move forward. You are strong, it is in your DNA.

Power is being told you’re not loved and not being destroyed by it.
