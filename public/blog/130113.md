#Sometimes
 The things I could not let go:

Sometimes you are like my mother.

I try so hard to impress you, but I’ll never become your pride, no matter what I’ve done, no matter what has passed. And all I ever will be is your burden. I am a child that you must take care of, not want to. When I bare all my insecurities for you to see, I am building a bridge. When you cast them away as if it’s my imagination, the river overflows. Then you are sincerely concerned, but I pretend that everything is fine. You play along with me; 没有人在哭。

Sometimes you are like my father.

I am perpetually waiting for you to return. And I look to the women that stand beside you, thinking to myself will I ever be that girl, the one you are crazy about, the one you respect. It does not matter what I have achieved; only imperfection remains in your eyes. You buy me over with little presents, necklaces, ice cream, small packages of kindness. I am but a prisoner falling in love with my kidnapper at the first sign of mercy.
