#Unreal
So it happened. And it was so much disappointment for both of you. Do not forget this moment. This lesson, where you feel regret for giving in so early. But understand also that this decision was powerful, because you chose to please yourself above all else. You do not need to feel smaller. You do not have to listen to those thoughts. None of this was your fault. Youâ€™ve simply discovered something new. Do not pine on this, longing for a past where you chose differently. Instead, hope that you have grown. Because you have. There is just a slight shift in the time when you will become aware.

Your second choice was very good. If your strength is derivative from other people, then you will never be able to stand alone.
