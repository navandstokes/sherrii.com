#Clouds
 1.

You change your mind like a girl changes clothes

This sweet sweet boy, you let him wait knowing that the end is unpleasant

He has opened your eyes to a new world

You reward him with a few turns and smiles

And you don’t regret it

You shouldn’t regret it

You do not owe anyone anything except your honesty

Everyday, dance dance dance

Everyday, fuck fuck fuck

Relish the sweet exhaustion of your body

This is what makes you feel so alive

This is what ignites your passion

Never live without it

Insomnia

So the question that you chose to ask

Will it be better where we’re going

And though the answer I don’t know for fact

Still my heart is saying oh yeah
