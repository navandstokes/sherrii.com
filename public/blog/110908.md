#Clockwork
For my mother:

I remember that first step
the panes of clarity ( shining painfully )
separating our past and my future
it would suddenly morph into
a window ( not of opportunity ) on the second level

I remember that first bus ride
mocking jester that was history ( it wasn’t funny )
when all your intents manifest a trap
I named my first pet monophobia ( he ate your passport )
triggering ( a mudslide of ) sticky situations

I remember that first night
independence is a double edged blade
all the hectic trailers of another fate ( skidding past )
nothing to stop you from stabbing the world
committing a murder to your kind ( but not a crime )

I remember the words
self-assured and ignorant ( determination is also two-faced )
pouring down my throat a burning liquid ( sun )
a fragment in macro lens ( terribly out of focus )
shattered and disabled ( unable )

I remember the taste
of a sour apple bought with today’s earnings
and of your jacket in my hands
soft like hope ( a thing with feathers )
( I hope ) we soar into tomorrow ( and let go )

I remember you in the end
as super hero ( and mission control )
it’s not in the thread count
but infused in your touch
gentle as petals falling

( lost and found )
