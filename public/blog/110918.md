#Invincible
I ripped your letter into pieces.

Each word is a tiny papercut. You hardly notice it. But by the end of the letter, the tears are enough to fill oceans. You say that our ionic attraction has turned to covalent chemistry. That the boil cooled down to lukewarm. That this is a comfortable temperature, peaceful.

Comfortable. What does that mean? Is that what we have become? This is the mark of a long marriage. If we are here now, then the pending divorce must be soon. Sure, this too shall pass. Pass on to become cold leftovers. Not heartwarming, not chilled. Just in that in-between purgatory of passitivity. Peaceful.

A bet with time? That is not at all what I want. I challenge time to a duel to the death. See who lasts longer. The promise is not what I’m look for, just the willingness. It’s the determination to persevere. I want to know now that you want to be there in the future. Not here.

Maybe cupid just doesn’t have hindsight. All I really need is a good liar. Authentic experiences I will seek outside of long-lasting, peaceful relationships. I will not waste my youth doing things I will inevitably do in the future.

Lukewarm tea is very comfortable. But I would rather have a steaming cup, difficult to hold, scalding to the tongue, but so hot that I become invincible to the winter cold.
