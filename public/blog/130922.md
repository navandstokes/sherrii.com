#Dreamlog - Vipassana
Here are the weird dreams during your mental diet.

- Dreamed of an insane mailman who showed an interest in you. With only slight doubt, you accepted him. During intercourse, you regretted this decision and tried to leave. He thought himself unloved by his father, jealous of an older brother. You become afraid, so incredibly afraid. You run from the house to the street and try to the phone the police in panic from a phone box. As you are speaking on the phone, you see him coming towards you. Intense fear.

Two things: First, you’ve been in this situation many times. Acceptance of a suitor only to regret it. This often leads to the creation of many cringe worthy moments. Second, you were only so afraid because you recognized yourself in him. You understood the power of those feelings, and the danger.

- As a segment to the previous dream, you dream of Logan and Duncan. Logan hides you; Duncan hunts you, as revenge.

- Clau and Rk write a slanderous book wherein they call you a slut/whore. J informs you of this. You confront them in anger.

- In the middle of a sleepover, you go to a new popular restaurant to buy food. A man kidnaps you on the way. In the front seat of his car, he suddenly asks you how you feel. You find that you are aroused.

- Same recurring dream of Yola’s club having an event. Afterwards, you walk to a hip restaurant with Ti.
