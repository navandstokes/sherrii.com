#Details
It's always the small things
You've been listening to the girl on the train 
At first you scoffed at the expediency with which female characters noticed sexual desire for male strangers. 
But now, you understand too well. 
It's always the small things. 

At the bar, he switches your dirty glass. 
You dream about his slender figure for a while. 
In class, he holds your hand by the wrist, firm and commanding. 
You are immediately infatuated 
His long fingers twist the lenses preciously
You imagine them along your spine 
His wide blue eyes bore into you
You can't bare to look away 
On the phone his laugh echos
You close your eyes to enjoy the reverberance 
Just a hand on your waist is enough 
Just a can of beer is enough

The devil is the details
