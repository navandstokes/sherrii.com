#Mathematics
A bit childish:

(Parentheses)

are very important in statements
(and in “I love you”s)

we always calculate wrongly
(simple mistakes with no excuses)

charging the positives negatively
(because miracles are only for romantics)

x and y only ever meet once
(there is no second chance)

0.618 squared doesn’t equal 1
(and I don’t know the last number to pie)

the root of this problem
(has no solution)

is a 3 behind the lens
(so small that it’s often forgotten)

love is not cubed but a sphere
(definitely not our circular arguments)

understanding must appear on both curves
(unless you intend for precise failure)

or else
(like us)

it is no longer an equation

(but merely undefined)
