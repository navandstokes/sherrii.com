#Pheonix
In a burst of emotion, I sent him a message full of hurt. And I was not even drunk. Out of everything, I never thought I would become this person. Yet I am. And it’s alright.

Here are the things I’ve learned:

1. That feeling you have, it’s a mixture, that’s why it’s so confusing. It is a blend of desire, of want for intimacy, of sadness, and strangely, of acceptance, and excitement.

2. It was always you all along. It does not matter, his actions, his kindness, his cruelty, they mean nothing compared to the battle inside you. That vicious cycle of disappointment, devastation, and desperation, it happens with or without him. It’s you.

3. Before you can love another, you must stop hurting yourself. Because without that, you will be unhappy, and he will feel insurmountable pressure.

4. It’s okay to have high expectations. This will give pressure to all relationships. You must accept that this is a part of you. But to move on, you will need to ask: how can I make this work?

I keep oscillating between two forms: one that is powerful and self-aware, and the other, vulnerable and lost. And that’s alright, because the first is a phoenix, rising out of the ashes of the second. And this cycle, this beautiful cycle, is what makes you stronger.
