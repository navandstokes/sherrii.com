#Sayonara
Sayonara, sayonara, the song whispers. Its slow drumming, soft lull, so peaceful. Sayonara, sayonara, I wonder if this was written for us. I wonder if after all this time, all those tears, all those smiles, it is time for goodbye. The distance between us suddenly seems so vast, so empty. I wonder if we are two seas of differing density. We can lie beside each other for thousands of years, yet every time we make contact, it is turbulent. I can not remember the beating of my heart that first time you paid for my coffee. I wonder if this is because my heart is moving for other things now, or for other people.

No, I still cannot let go. Sayonara, sayonara, I will learn to say this.

さよなら
さよなら
また逢える

Sayonara, sayonara, mata aeru. We will surely meet again.
