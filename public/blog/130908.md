#Goodbye
さよなら
さよなら
また逢える

I was able to say it.

But don’t forget his kindness. Don’t forget your promise. Don’t forget this dream of a future together. Don’t forget that he loves you, more than you’ll ever know or understand, more than you’ll ever need, more than enough to stay with you forever. Do not forget this kindness, this trust, this love. It is so precious. It’s no longer just comfort. No, it is so much deeper.

I love you. We will meet again.
