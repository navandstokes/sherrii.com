#Deterioration 
 It's funny, how you allow yourself to be fooled and fooled again.

7:20 pm - Why hasn't he messaged you? You are late already. Maybe he's late too. Time to leave so you can get to the library to meet him.

7:30 pm - On the way, you contemplate texting him. 

7:40 pm - You have arrived, still no message. You resolve to not message him and feign independence. You find a less than ideal seat on the second floor.  

8:15 pm - You have been studying for a while. You suddenly find that he has messaged you 20 minutes ago, asking if you are there. You reply that you are on the second floor. Where is he?  Finally, you have won this time.

8:16 pm - He just got home. 

8:17 pm - Is he coming then?

8:18 pm - No.  

8:19 pm - You realize, once again, that he does not care about you walking home late, being stood up, being alone. This is not even remotely surprising. Yet you switch your playlist to catharsis. 

8:45 pm - You still cannot focus.
